## Installation

The required Python packages are listed in `pyproject.toml`. Install them together with this project using `pip`:

```bash
pip install .
```

`tkinter` must also be available. It is typically included with many Python distributions but may require a separate installation on some systems.

### Building a Windows executable

You can package the Streamlit interface into a single Windows executable using
PyInstaller. First install it with `pip install pyinstaller`.

Run the provided `build_windows_exe.bat` script from a Windows command
prompt:

```bat
build_windows_exe.bat
```

The script bundles everything inside the `data` directory so that any price
lists placed there (for example an initial `master_dataset.xlsx`) are available
once the executable is launched. The resulting binary will appear in the
`dist` folder.

### Price normalization

The `normalize_price` helper converts textual prices into numeric values. By
default it assumes European formatting (e.g. `1.234,56`). Pass
`style="en"` to handle English formatted numbers such as `1,234.56`.

### Code and description extraction

Product entries may contain material codes alongside descriptions in various formats. The parser recognises patterns such as `CODE / Description`, `Description / CODE`, `Description (CODE)` and `(CODE) Description` before falling back to a simple prefix-based split.


### CLI usage

Extract prices from files on the command line and save the merged result using the provided console script:

```bash
smart-price-parser data/list.xlsx another.pdf -o merged_prices.xlsx
```

### Running the Streamlit interface

Launch the web UI locally with:

```bash
smart-price-app
```

From the interface you can upload Excel/PDF price lists and search the
resulting master dataset.
